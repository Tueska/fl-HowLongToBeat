# FlowLauncher HowLongToBeat

This is a plugin for the [FlowLauncher](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher) app that allows you to easily track the time it takes to beat your favourite games. It uses the [HowLongToBeat](https://howlongtobeat.com/) database to provide accurate play time information for thousands of games.

## Installation

To install the plugin, you must have Flow Launcher installed on your system, and then install the plugin from the Plugin Store or via `pm install beat how long to beat`. After installation you will be prompted to install/select Node.js if you have not done so.


## Usage

To use the plugin, simply open FlowLauncher and type `beat` followed by the name of a video game. The plugin will then access the HowLongToBeat database and return information about the estimated time to beat the game.
